1. Start by placing the maximum value (2 * 𝑛) in the top-left cell (1, 1), and the second maximum value (2 * 𝑛 - 1) in the bottom-right cell (2, 𝑛).
1. Fill the remaining cells in the first row and the second row using the remaining numbers in descending order while alternating rows.
1. If the row has an even number of cells, start filling the row from the second cell, otherwise start from the first cell.
