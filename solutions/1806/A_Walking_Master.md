This problem involves a character, YunQian, who can move on a Cartesian coordinate system. She can either move diagonally to the top-right or horizontally to the left. Given her initial position (a, b) and her desired destination (c, d), the task is to determine the minimum number of moves she needs to make to get there, or to state if it's impossible for her to reach that point.

**Logic:**

The logic to solve the problem is as follows:

If the destination's y-coordinate (d) is less than the starting y-coordinate (b), YunQian can't reach the destination, so output "-1".

If the difference between the destination's x-coordinate (c) and the starting x-coordinate (a) is greater than the difference between the y-coordinates (d-b), YunQian can't reach the destination, so output "-1".

Otherwise, the minimum number of steps is the difference between the y-coordinates (d-b) plus the absolute difference between this value and the difference between the x-coordinates.

**Naive Approach:**

A naive approach might involve trying to simulate every possible step YunQian could make from the starting point to the end point. However, this would be very inefficient as the number of possible paths can be very large.
