This problem involves an array of integers. The score of this array is calculated as follows: you add up each pair of adjacent numbers in the array to create a new array, and then find the MEX (minimum excluded number) of this new array. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array. Your task is to rearrange the original array in such a way that its score (the MEX of the new array) is minimized.

**Logic:**

The logic to solve this problem is based on counting the number of zeros in the array and comparing it with the half of the array length. If the number of zeros is equal to the length of the array, the minimum score will be 1. If the number of zeros is less than or equal to half of the array length, the minimum score will be 0. Otherwise, it depends on the maximum number in the array: if it's greater than 1, the minimum score will be 1, otherwise, it will be 2.

**Naive Approach:**

A naive approach would be to generate all possible permutations of the array and calculate the score for each permutation. However, this approach would be very time-consuming and impractical for large arrays.
