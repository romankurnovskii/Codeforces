1. Iterate through all lowercase Latin letters (26 iterations).
2. For each letter, split the input string `s` into substrings, using the current letter as the delimiter.
3. For each substring created in step 2, calculate the minimum number of operations required to make all the letters in the substring the same. This is done by finding the length of the substring and calculating the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to that length. The number of operations required is the exponent of that power of 2.
4. Keep track of the maximum number of operations required among all the substrings for the current letter.
5. After iterating through all the letters, find the minimum number of operations among all the maximums calculated in step 4. This minimum will be the answer to the problem.
