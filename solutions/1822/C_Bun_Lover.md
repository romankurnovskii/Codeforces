This problem involves a special type of bun called a cinnabon roll which has chocolate poured on it in a spiral pattern. 

The size of the cinnabon roll is defined as the length of the outer side of the roll, and we want to find the total length of the chocolate layer on a roll of a given size.

### Naive Approach

The naive approach would be to manually calculate the total length of the spiral for each roll size by counting the number of squares in the spiral pattern. 

### Logic

We need to calculate the total length of the chocolate layer, which is actually the total length of the spiral pattern. The length of the spiral pattern can be calculated using the formula: `length = n * 4 + n + (n - 1) * (n - 2)`
