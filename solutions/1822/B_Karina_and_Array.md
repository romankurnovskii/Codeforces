This problem involves an array of integers and the task is to maximize the product of any two adjacent numbers in the array. However, to make things more interesting, you're allowed to remove some numbers from the array. 

Task is to decide which numbers, if any, to remove in order to maximize the product of the remaining adjacent numbers.

## Logic

The highest product of two numbers in the array can be achieved in one of two ways:
1. The product of the two largest positive numbers.
1. The product of the two smallest negative numbers (since the product of two negative numbers is a positive number).

So, you first sort the array, then calculate the product of the first two numbers and the last two numbers. The maximum of these two products is your answer.
