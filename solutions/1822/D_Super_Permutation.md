A permutation is a sequence of distinct integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once. This problem is about finding a "super-permutation", a specific type of permutation. 

In a super-permutation, if we form a new sequence by calculating the cumulative sum of the original sequence and taking modulo n, this new sequence (after adding 1 to each element) should also be a permutation.  

Task is to find such a super-permutation if it exists.

## Naive Approach
The naive approach would be to generate all permutations of the sequence from 1 to n and check if they are super-permutations. However, this approach is highly inefficient because the number of permutations is `n!`, which is very large for large n.

## Logic
A super-permutation exists only for `n = 1` or `n` is an even number. For `n = 1`, the super-permutation is `[1]`. For even `n`, the permutation can be constructed by arranging the even numbers in decreasing order and the odd numbers in increasing order alternatively.
