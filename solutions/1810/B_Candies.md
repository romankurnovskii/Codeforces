The solution to this problem focuses on manipulating the number of candies by applying either the first or second spell. The idea is to check if it is possible to reach the target number of candies (n) within 40 steps. 

For each step, the algorithm determines whether it is better to use the first or the second spell based on whether the result of the spell will be closer to the target number. 

The algorithm continues applying spells and updating the number of candies until it reaches the target number or reaches the 40-step limit. 

If the target is reached, the sequence of spells is printed, otherwise, it prints -1.
