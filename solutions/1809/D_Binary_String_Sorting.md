The idea of this solution is to iterate through the binary string, tracking the counts of zeros and ones. It evaluates the cost of sorting the string by considering various operations, such as swapping consecutive elements or removing elements. 

By comparing the costs of these different operations, the solution determines the minimum number of coins required to sort the string in non-decreasing order.
