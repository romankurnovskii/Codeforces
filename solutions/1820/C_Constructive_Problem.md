The key to solving this problem is understanding how the MEX is calculated and how the operation changes the array. 

The MEX of the array is the smallest non-negative integer that doesn't exist in the array. 

If we assign a certain non-negative integer value to all elements within a subsegment of the array, we are essentially adding more of that integer to the array. 

This could potentially increase the MEX of the array by exactly one if we choose the right subsegment and the right integer value.
