This problem involves a binary string, and with that string, you construct a square mesa (table). The first row of the mesa contains the original string. 

The subsequent rows contain a cyclic shift of the string by one to the right. 

Need to find the rectangle within this mesa that consists only of ones ('1') and has the largest area. 

The challenge is to find this rectangle's maximum possible area. If there are no rectangles consisting of ones, the answer should be 0.

### Logic

The logic to solve this problem revolves around finding the longest contiguous sequence of '1's in the input string (including its cyclic shifts) and using this sequence to calculate the maximum area.

This area is calculated as the product of the half-length of this sequence (rounded up and down respectively). 

For edge cases where all characters are '1's, the maximum area would be the square of the length of the string.
