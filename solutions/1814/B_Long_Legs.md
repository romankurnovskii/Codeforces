1. Iterate through possible leg lengths (`m`) from 1 to a large number (e.g., `10^5`).
1. For each leg length `m`, calculate the number of horizontal jumps (`jumps_a`) and vertical jumps (`jumps_b`) the robot needs to reach cells `a` and `b`, respectively.
1. The total moves required for each leg length `m` is the sum of `m` (number of times the robot increases its leg length), `jumps_a`, and `jumps_b`.
1. Keep track of the minimum moves among all leg lengths.


Iterates through possible leg lengths (m) and calculates the number of horizontal jumps (jumps_a) and vertical jumps (jumps_b) required to reach the target cell (a,b) for each leg length. The minimum number of moves for the robot is the sum of the leg length increases and the number of horizontal and vertical jumps. By iterating through leg lengths and keeping track of the minimum moves, the solution finds the optimal leg length and the minimum number of moves required to reach the target cell.
