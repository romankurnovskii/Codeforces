1. First, check if n is even. If it is, you can always represent n using coins of denomination `2 (2*x = n, and y = 0)`.
1. If `n` is odd, then the only way to represent `n` is by using an odd number of `k` coins and an even number of 2 coins (since the sum of an odd number of odd integers and an even number of even integers is odd). In this case, check if `n >= k` and `k` is odd. If so, it's possible to represent n using these coins.

If n is even, then you can always represent n using only coins of denomination 2. If n is odd, it checks if n is greater than or equal to k and if k is odd. If this condition is satisfied, you can represent n using the given coins. Otherwise, it's not possible to represent n using the coins.
