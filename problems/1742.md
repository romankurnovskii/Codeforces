# 1742 Problems

## [1742A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1742/A)

### Description

Note that if a stripe is painted last, then the entire stripe appears in the final picture (because no other stripe is covering it).

Since rows are only painted red and columns are only painted blue, we can just check if any row contains 8 Rs. If there is such a row, then red was painted last; otherwise, blue was painted last.

### Solution

```python
import sys


def input(): return sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\r\n')


def read_int():
    return int(input())


def check(grid):
    return any(all(ch == 'R' for ch in row) for row in grid)


for _ in range(read_int()):
    input()
    print(['B', 'R'][check([input() for _ in range(8)])])

```
